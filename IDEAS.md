### Things to note

- Please see the Postman collection here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3683187/UVXerd9a

- I have used the [PBF Approach](https://phauer.com/2020/package-by-feature/) for structing the project

- Application of JSend Specification: See [here](https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend) or anything similar. It's a speficification that allows you to send API response in a consistent and readable matter. It has three 2-3 compulsory field names.

```
    {
        status: "success",
        statusCode: 200 //this is optional though because it can be gotten from the header
        data: {
            keys: []
        }
    }
```
- Some Design patterns were used (`Singleton`, `Facade`, `Strategic pattern`)

- Application of some SOLID principles were applied. For instance, `Single Responsibility Principle`, `Dependency Inversion`

- Dependency Injection principle and Dependency Injection container was used

- API versioning was used because it helps us to iterate faster when the needed changes are identified in the APIs. Versioning could be by URL or using a custom request header. It's a good practice to have it implemented in production-ready APIs.

- Abstraction was heavily used. This is evident in a couple of places, 

 - like how the `env.ts` file gets the enviroment variables and then makes it available for whichever service or components needs it.
 - like how the `CacheService` does not directly depend on any object or lower-level service(s). And with this approach our service is not tightly coupled to use just one specific database or datasource. For instance, If one day we want to use MySQL or PosgresQL or just whatever DB, the `CacheService.ts` will not change a bit. We just need to create the object in `di-container`, inject it into the constructor and `CacheService` class will work just as normal. Here, we applied `Abstraction`, `Loose coupling`. 

- `src/services` contains the service(s) and also the DAOs (Data access objects) which helps abstracts the complexity of services directly making database calls but instead an indirection (`Dependency Inversion`).

- Separation of concerns and layering components: Service does not directly make database calls but instead should be moved to a controller. Services, Routes, Controllers, DAOs, Database Queries are all seperated as "components" and injected into which ever service needs it. 

- The `Repository` design pattern was used. This is evident where we have all the database calls are in a file and an interface is used to interact with it from the outside. 

- I applied the principle and idea of LRU. 

- The Cache Capacity is configurable and passed from the environment variable. So the capacity is set when the `CacheService` class gets instantiated.

- OOP Paradigm was used. Notable ones are `Polymorphism` (using `implement`) and `Inheritance` (using `extends`)

- Unit testing was done

- `Boom` was used. It provides a set of utilities for returning HTTP friendly errors in a large scale system

### Things i would have done
- Write more tests. Both unit, e2e and integration tests
- Validation, Authentication, Authorization
- Dockerization
- More (smart) configuration on Logger (winston, bunyan)
- Monitoring (with New Relic, Prometheus/Grafana)
- Test coverage
- Maybe i would have made the TTL configurable from the environment variable like cache capacity also. But i decided to make it 2 minutes (for testing purposes). Don't know if that's righr or wrong
